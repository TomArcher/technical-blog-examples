# Sample Code: Modeling Heat Capacity and Evaporation with Python: Why Water Warms Slowly but Cools Fast

This repository contains the companion code for the blog post:

👉 [Modeling Heat Capacity and Evaporation with Python: Why Water Warms Slowly but Cools Fast](https://tomarcher.io/posts/thermo-water-energy-balance/) on [Signal & Syntax](https://tomarcher.io/).

This code addresses the classic question: *"Why does it take weeks (or more) in 90°F (32°C) to heat a swimming pool, but only a few chilly nights to turn cold?"*

The blog post explains the problem setup, the prompts used to explore it with AI, and the lessons learned from modeling the scenario. This sample provides the runnable Python code behind that exploration.
