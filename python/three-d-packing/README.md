# Sample Code: Truck Packing

This repository contains the companion code for the blog post:

üëâ [From Ice Shows to Algorithms: Cracking the Truck-Packing Problem](https://tomarcher.io/posts/three-d-packing/) on [Signal & Syntax](https://tomarcher.io/).

This code explores the classic 3D packing problem‚Äîfitting items into a truck efficiently.  
What begins as a heuristic coding exercise turns out to be a real-world challenge across industries like logistics, e-commerce fulfillment, air cargo, and warehouse optimization.  
The blog post explains the problem setup, the prompts used to generate visualization code with AI, and the lessons learned from modeling space utilization.
