# Sample Code: How Large Language Models (LLMs) Learn: Calculus and the Search for Understanding

This repository contains the companion code for the blog post:

👉 [How Large Language Models (LLMs) Learn: Calculus and the Search for Understanding](https://tomarcher.io/posts/how-large-language-models-learn/) on [Signal & Syntax](https://tomarcher.io/).

The abstract mathematics of gradient descent becomes clearer when you can see it move. This directory contains simple Python and MATLAB examples that shows how a model "learns" to find the minimum of a function:
